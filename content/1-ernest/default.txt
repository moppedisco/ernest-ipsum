Hemingway’s writing is clear, and without ornamentation. Perfect for web copy.

Designers use lorem ipsum placeholder copy each and every day – as if the block of text they are designing around had no meaning. As if those weren’t words. Ernest Ipsum’s aims are twofold; to give designers access to copy that has meaning, beauty and heart – and to introduce them to a writer who’s work is normally relegated to the high school classroom.

Web copy esspecially should be direct, sparse and meaningful – both in, and inbetween, the lines. Ernest Hemingway would have been a damn good copywriter. His writing is as much about what is said as what isn’t. He is, and always will be, the Great American Writer. 

Our hope is that Ernest Ipsum will add some placeholder text – and much-needed gravitas – to your next design project. At least until your copywriter gets briefed on the project – which you probably should have done already, by the way. 

But our greatest hope is that the pixel-obsessed out there put down the Wacom pen and the iPhone 6 Plus and pick up a book. One written by Ernest Fucking Hemingway.
